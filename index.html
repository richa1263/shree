                        I had a lifelong passion for health and wellness. I've been working in this field for more then 10 years now. I was diagonised as a Myopathy patient back in 2005. A disease which cannot be cured. -> Myopathy is a general term referring to any disease that affects the muscles that control voluntary movement in the body. Patients experience muscle weakness due to a dysfunction of the muscle fibers. Some myopathies are genetic and can be passed from parent to child. Others are acquired later in life and can be due to autoimmune disease, known as myositis, metabolic disorders or other causes. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Being a Myopathy patient I was not supposed to do heavy works and compulsory needed bed rest. I need to visit hospitals and ICUs frequently, but I had a strong will power to be a normal person again and lately I started experimenting on myself with different therapies. But nothing worked for me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Back in 2013 I joined with Naturopathy and nuetracuticals; and interestingly it worked for me. After that I joined with Naturopathy and achieved my ambition to be a Naturopathy Doctor, I've cured and healed thousands of people in the terms of Naturopathy, Neutracuticals, Marma Therapy and <a href="">P3Y</a> across the world from 2015 till now. We established SHREE NATUROPATHY in January 2022; dedicated to patient centered care.

            As a strong advocate for integrative medicine where the focus is placed on the patient as a whole, I specialize in naturopathic integrative cancer care, supporting patients through all stages of treatment and beyond. I strive to change the environment in which cancer grows, including the physical, mental, and emotional realms of life. In addition to working with cancer patients, I see a variety of other conditions because naturopathic medicine is about treating the patient as a whole. I treat the patient. Other conditions include women’s and men’s health conditions, digestive issues, skin issues, autoimmune, hormonal imbalances and general wellness.

                <p>
                    Naturopathic medicine is an evidence-based coordinated approach to health care that supports the self-healing process and focuses on addressing the root cause of illness rather than simply treating or suppressing symptoms. The treatment plans are tailored to meet the individual needs of each patient and reflect whole-person healthcare.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Naturopathic doctors are detectives for your health, combining your history, symptoms, lab tests and physical exams to understand the patterns of imbalance. Where reactive care can no longer safely suppress symptoms or cut out a diseased organ, we can provide empowering lifestyle changes to reverse the cause of distress and improve quality of life

                WHAT IS MARMA THERAPY ALL ABOUT?
            </div>
            <div class="marma_ans">
                <p>
                    MARMA THERAPY is a 5,000-year-old Indian Ayurvedic practice and the main focus of marma therapy is the opening of energy channels for healing the body, mind, and spirit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Sanskrit word “marma” actually means vulnerable point. Marma therapy harnesses the energies in the marma points for healing. Simply, Marma Therapy has an effect on the subtle energy of Marma points to relieve stiff muscles and boost blood circulation.
                    Marma therapy has an immediate healing and relaxing effect on the body when used as a treatment for others or as a self-treatment. Marma therapy involves subtle, and sometimes a more profound touch on marma points. The touch can bring about immense healing and rejuvenation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Marma therapy works to clear stagnation in the vital energy points and thus increase vitality within the corresponding body parts. Because marma techniques work at the level of raw prana, its ability to facilitate physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual healing is immense. Ayurvedic physician suggests that flushing energy within the marma points can activate the body’s inner pharmacy, shifting one’s biochemistry and causing the unfoldment of radical, alchemical changes.
